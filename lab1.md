## cd
1. cd no directory
* ![Image](cdnothing.png)
* The working directory when the command was run was /home.
* I got the output in the image as cd is used to change the working directory, and if you write cd with no argument, it returns you to your home directory. Since I am already in my home directory nothing changed.
* This is not an error

2. cd working directory
* ![Image](cddirectory.png)
* The working directory when the command was run was /home
* cd is used to change your working directory; when I ran cd lecture1, it changed my working directory to lecture1 instead of my home directory, this is shown by the lecture1 text that is in green.
* There are no errors in this example. However, there may be an error if the specified directory doesn't exist.

3. cd path to file
* ![image](cdfile.png)
* The current working directory when the file is run is /home.
* I got that output as cd only works for paths to directories and is not used with a path to a file as an argument.
* There is an error, as cd only works with paths to directories and not files.
