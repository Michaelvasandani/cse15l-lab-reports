# Lab Report 1
Horizontal rule:

---
## cd
1. cd no directory
* ![Image](cdnothing.png)
* The working directory when the command was run was /home.
* I got the output in the image as cd is used to change the working directory, and if you write cd with no argument it returns you to your home directory. Since I am already in my home directory nothing changed.
* This is not an error

2. cd working directory
* ![Image](cddirectory.png)
* The working directory when the command was run was /home
* cd is used to change your working directory; when I ran cd lecture1, it changed my working directory to lecture1 instead of my home directory.
* There are no errors.
